It's a best practice to either "pull" from the main branch to get the latest changes to the main branch, or pull "upstream" of the branch you are creating. This is important because your version of the main branch on your computer needs to be up to date with the main branch on GitHub.

Follow these steps to create a branch:

Navigate to the repository folder on your computer.
In Terminal on macOS or Git Bash on Windows, type git pull or git pull origin main and press Enter.
Type git checkout -b Simple_Leaflet_Map and press Enter.
git checkout lets us navigate between branches.
-b indicates we are creating a new branch.
The name of the new branch follows -b.
After pressing Enter, your terminal or Git Bash should return the following:

Switched to a new branch 'Simple_Leaflet_Map'


Now we are in the Simple_Leaflet_Map branch. Confirm this by typing git branch and pressing Enter. The output in Terminal or Git Bash should look as follows, with an asterisk next to the branch name:

* Simple_Leaflet_Map
  main

At this point, the folder structure on your computer hasn't changed. The files you had in your main branch are now in your Simple_Leaflet_Map branch.
